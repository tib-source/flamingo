      Ethiopian cuisine (Amharic: የኢትዮጵያ ምግብ?) characteristically consists of
      vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes. This is usually in the form of
      wat, a thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread, which
      is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented
      teff flour. Ethiopians eat exclusively with their right hands, using
      pieces of injera to pick up bites of entrées and side dishes.

       The cuisine is one of the world’s healthiest and most flavorful, not to mention most photogenic. Ethiopians are rightly proud of their culture and take pains to preserve traditional food ways...
