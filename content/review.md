	  review: I was taken to this restaurant by a friend of mine who is Eritrean and as I had never had Ethiopian/Eritrean food. This is a lovely little restaurant that has seating as you walk in and then downstairs there is a load more seating. As...More

	  review: We fancied a change and had heard of this place. I donâ€™t know how authentic it is as I have nothing to compare it to, however it was full of Ethiopians having lunch, thus seems fairly authentic to me.  The man serving is was very friendly, however it took a very long time for our food to come out, and other tables of locals were being served before us even though they came in after us.  The food was interesting and tasty, although the sour bread became a little monotonous after a while. You need to eat this with every bite as you eat with your fingers (which we actually enjoyed doing).  Good value, especially local beers at Â£2.50. No service charge and a nice experience. However we are unlikely to return.

	  review: Go and try something new - we did and really enjoyed it. Ethiopean food is delicious. We got the large Injera bread with a spicy lentil stew and a milder chickpea stew. It was superb, plus its a really nice social way of eating. The stew is just spooned onto the bread, and you all just rip pieces of the bread (which is more akin to a thin pancake) and scoop the stew. Really nice and very inexpensive. Pity the Ethiopian beer had run out as I would have liked to have tried that too - maybe next time.

	  review: First time for us and Ethiopian food, and a rather nice experience it was too. Food extremely flavourful, plenty of it, and loved the Injera. Pity the Ethiopian beer had ran out as would have been nice to try it. Good service, and would definitely visit again. Very reasonably priced.

	  review: The wat selections were very well made and delicious. The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere. Itâ€™s definitely worth a visit.

	  review: I always welcome eating Ethiopian food but have it far too rarely (but there are an increasing number of restaurants in London).  I had the Doro (chicken) Wot and Shiro (chickpeas?) served with injera (flat, slightly sour bread - almost pancake texture). All was very decent.  Service was friendly and efficient.

	  review: We visited for lunch. The restaurant was nearly empty. It is an interesting place with eclectic and african decor. A nice smell of frankincense greeted us upon entering. The smell was then complemented by the warmth of servers and patrons alike. We tasted several dishes (there is a flamingo plate for 2-3 people) and they were very good. The portions are very generous and indeed we did not manage to finish our order. This is the usual Ethiopian fare with food served over and with some spongy bread that is then used to eat with your own hands. We very much enjoyed this style of eating (our 3 yo did too) as well as the communal aspect of it (one plate in the center for all of us). We also had Ethiopian Tej (a root fermented with water and honey), good and interesting but a bit strong/aromatic a flavor to have too much of it (a bit like port in a way). Finally, we had coffee with a coffee ceremony that entailed roasting the beans and then serving the coffee in a nice wooden tray with frankincense burning. Very scenographic and interesting, and the coffee was also very good. The only negative of the visit was the timing of service, it took us a bit over two hours for the whole affair at lunch time and with just few other patrons around. It is true there were also quite a few take away orders but I would not go to Flamingo for speed of service, other than that it is a nice and pleasant experience and a great meal, I would reccommend it and 'll certainly go back in other occasions when we have plenty of time to spare.

	  review: The meal was excellent, I must say, the service wasn't too bad and the food didn't take too long. On ringing to book with the taste card the first 2 people that picked up didn't understand English so i wasn't too sure if the booking was confirmed. Once the bill came and we presented the Taste card it was not accepted as she said the meal portions would have been different if I mentioned it first. It all seemed very confusing as they took the booking knowing it was a Taste card booking but miscommunication caused a bit of a bit of a downer. Mention taste card before ordering.

	  review: The food was average and the staff provided little assistance with choosing dishes.  A friend brought their taste card along - they had followed all the rules, ringing through to book a table and mentioning that they were going to be using a taste card.  When it came to paying the bill, the staff member complained that he had forgotten we had a taste card and had given us full sized portions. He wanted us to pay full price, but finally begrudgingly accepted the taste card.  So expect smaller portions if you come in on a taste card (surely this is not consistent with taste card rules?).

	  review: Well we came here on a Monday and booked on Tastecard. Drinks are very cheap, Â£3 for wine and beer is Â£2.50. Had 2 lovely starters and the main was good and very neatly presented. This was our first time at an Ethiopian restaurant.

	  review: This was my first Ethopian meal and I can't wait to go back for more. Everything was delicious with an amazing blend of flavours - even the bread. Service isn't fast but it isn't that slow either. We were dry happy with our meal, which was decent value.

	  review: We decided to try Flamingo after reading the recent positive reviews on here, and were extremely disappointed. We would not eat here again. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was terrible and incredibly slow.  We had made a reservation and so were seated immediately (although they did make several people they had just sat at the table get up and move, which was awkward). They left the menus and only returned to take our orders after about 15 minutes. The waitress spoke absolutely no English - not even enough to take our orders, and certainly not enough to answer questions about the food. Even pointing to the items on the menu was hardly enough, and we all ordered the same thing (the sharing platter)!  About 15 minutes later, the waitress came back and relayed that they were out of the appetiser we had ordered, so we ordered a different one. About 10 minutes after that, a different waitress came back and again explained that they were out of the appetiser we had ordered. The first waitress apparently had not understood our second order.  By this point it had been over half an hour, and they still had not brought our drinks or any food. A few minutes later the drinks arrived. One was served in a cracked glass.  After another 30 minutes (so more than 1 hour after we were seated) we still had not been brought any food and no server had stopped by the table to update us. I flagged down a waitress and asked when we might expect to be served. Within 5 minutes of that the food finally arrived.  The food was certainly not as good as other Ethiopian restaurants we have been to. The tej was sour, the injera was dry and the other flavours uninspiring. The largest dish in the Â£32 sharing platter was a salad of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. The meat dishes contained very little meat (e.g. a single chicken wing covered in sauce) and were difficult to share between two people. A lot of the dishes that should have been hot were served cold. Perhaps they sat out a long time before being brought to our table.  We will not be going back to this place.

	  review: This tired looking restaurant was a lovely surprise! I had never tried injera - the unleavened, fermented bread of Ethiopia and it did not look appetising at all when it arrived. However, I am glad I persisted and had the Doro Ingudai which was a taste sensation - yum ~ scooping it up with bits of the injera was fun and finger licking good!!

	  review: We thought the food really very good (we already know Ethiopian food) and would go back often - but the pricing is wrong. The Â£32 price tag for the Flamingo Special is outrageous as it is not plentiful (although, as I say, it was very good and fresh). It was barely enough for two of us. And Â£9 for the small piece of chicken (I think wing) in the dish my husband chose was also over-priced. I think the prices may be skewed to the Groupon, Discount Voucher customer, i.e. if you get the meal for the 50% or even 30% discount you'd feel happier with the bill. This is sad because the normal paying customer probably won't go back.
