# Personal Project 

Welcome to the flamingo website source code. This is a website made for a local restaurant so I could obtain some developement experience and exposure within my community.

To Do List: 
- Build a fully resonsive front end using react 
- Create a django backend 
- Add user authentication - low priority
- Add table booking functionality - high priority
- Make an admin dashboard so restaurant owner can add new food and etc by them selves.

Thats all I can think of for now.
