# Personal Project 

Welcome to the flamingo website source code. This is a website made for a local restaurant so I could obtain some developement experience and exposure within my community.

To Do List: 
- Build a fully resonsive front end using react âœ…
- Create a express backend âœ… 
- Add user authentication - low priority : ðŸ’© useless feature for now
- Add table booking functionality - high priority : âœ…
- Make an admin dashboard so restaurant owner can add new food and etc by them selves. : ðŸ”œ

Thats all I can think of for now.
